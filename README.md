A large Indian retail chain has stores across 3 states in India: Maharashtra, Telangana and Kerala. These stores stock products across various categories such as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), eatables / perishables and others. Managing the inventory is crucial for the revenue stream of the retail chain. Meeting the demand is important to not lose potential revenue, while at the same time stocking excessive products could lead to losses.
